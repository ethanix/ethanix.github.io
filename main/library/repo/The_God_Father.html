<p>FADE FROM BLACK: Int. of Don Corleone's home office -day

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BONASERA (seated in front of the Don's desk, facing the camera)

<p>I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the 

<p>American fashion. I gave her freedom, but -- I taught her never to dishonor her family. She 

<p>found a boyfriend; not an Italian. She went to the movies with him; she stayed out late. I 

<p>didn't protest. Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made 

<p>her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her 

<p>honor. So they beat her, like an animal. When I went to the hospital, her nose was a'broken. 

<p>Her jaw was a'shattered, held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain. 

<p>But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life -- beautiful girl. Now she will 

<p>never be beautiful again.

<p>[Bonasera breaks down. The Don gestures to Sonny to give Bonasera a drink]

<p>Sorry...

<p>[Bonasera, taking the drink, sips from the shot glass]

<p>I -- I went to the police, like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The 

<p>judge sentenced them to three years in prison -- suspended sentence. Suspended sentence! 

<p>They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastard, 

<p>they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, "for justice, we must go to Don Corleone."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE (sitting behind his desk, petting a cat)

<p>Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BONASERA

<p>What do you want of me? Tell me anything. But do what I beg you to do.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE

<p>What is that?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>[Bonasera gets up to whisper his request into Don Corleone's ear]

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>That I cannot do. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BONASERA

<p>I'll give you anything you ask.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE

<p>We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you came to me for counsel, 

<p>for help.  I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of 

<p>coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here: you 

<p>never wanted my friendship. And uh, you were afraid to be in my debt.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BONASERA

<p>I didn't want to get into trouble.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE

<p>I understand. You found paradise in America, had a good trade, made a good living. The 

<p>police protected you; and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend of me. But 

<p>uh, now you come to me and you say -- "Don Corleone give me justice." -- But you don't ask 

<p>with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead, 

<p>you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you uh ask me to do 

<p>murder, for money.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BONASERA

<p>I ask you for justice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE

<p>That is not justice; your daughter is still alive.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BONASERA

<p>Then they can suffer then, as she suffers. 

<p>(then)

<p>How much shall I pay you?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE (stands, turning his back toward Bonasera)

<p>Bonasera... Bonasera... What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? Had 

<p>you come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering 

<p>this very day.  And that by chance if an honest man such as yourself should make enemies, 

<p>then they would become my enemies.  And then they would fear you.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BONASERA

<p>Be my friend --

<p>(then, after bowing and the Don shrugs)

<p>-- Godfather?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE (after Bonasera kisses his hand)

<p>Good.

<p>(then)

<p>Some day, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But uh, 

<p>until that day -- accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BONASERA (as he leaves the room)

<p>Grazie, Godfather.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE

<p>Prego.

<p>(then, to Tom Hagen, after Bonasera leaves the room)

<p>Ah, give this to ah, Clemenza. I want reliable people; people that aren't gonna be carried 

<p>away. I'm  mean, we're not murderers, despite of what this undertaker says.

<p>Is this -- Is this necessary?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>(then, starting over, which continues throughout the following dialogue)

<p>Don -- Don Corleone...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>Well, who is he? What's his name?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>TOM 

<p>How do you do.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>KAY

<p>How do you do, Tom

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>TOM (into Michael's ear)

<p>Your father's been asking for you

<p>(then, to Kay, before he leaves)

<p>Very nice to meet you

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>KAY

<p>Nice to meet you

<p>(then, after Tom exits to bring Luca into the Don's office)

<p>If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL

<p>Oh, ah, that -- when my brother Sonny was a kid, he found Tom Hagen in the street. And he 

<p>had no home -- and so my father took him in -- and he's been with us ever since.  He's a good 

<p>lawyer. Not a Sicilian, but -- I think he's gonna be consiglieri.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>KAY

<p>What's that?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL

<p>Well, when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to this personal service contract; 

<p>with a big band leader. And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it. 

<p>Now, Johnny is my father's godson. And my father went to see this band leader, and he 

<p>offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go. But the band leader said no.  <a href="../ram/mikekay.ram">So the next day, my father went to see him; only this time with Luca Brasi.  And within an hour, he signed a release, for a certified check for $1,000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>KAY

<p>How'd he do that?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>KAY

<p>What was that?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL

<p>Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains -- or his signature -- would be on the contract. 

<p>(then)

<p>That's a true story.

<p>it'll make him a big star. And I'm gonna run him out of the business, and let me tell you why.

<p>(then, after he stands)

<p>Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable proteges. For five years 

<p>we had her under training. Singing lessons; acting lessons, dancing lessons. I spent hundreds 

<p>of thousands of dollars on her. I was gonna make her a big star! And let me be even more 

<p>frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, and it's not all dollars and cents.  

<p>She was beautiful; she was young, she was innocent. She was the greatest piece of ass I ever 

<p>had, and I had'em all over the world! And then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive-

<p>oil voice, and guinea charm. And she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me look 

<p>ridiculous! And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous! Now you 

<p>get the hell outta here! And if that gumbah tries any rough stuff, you tell him I ain't no band 

<p>leader! Yeah, I heard that story....

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>TOM [Sollozzo scenes still intercut]

<p>Well, I say yes. There's more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking 

<p>at. Now if we don't get into it, somebody else will. Maybe one of the Five Families, maybe 

<p>all of them.  Now with the money they earn, they can buy more police and political power; 

<p>then they come after us. Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; an' they're the best 

<p>things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future.  An' if we don't get a piece of that 

<p>action, we risk everything we have -- I mean not now, but ah ten years from now.

<p>I want you to take care of that sonofabitch right away. Paulie sold out the old man, that

<p>find no one at the nurse's station. He walks down the hall to check an office, and only sees a 

<p>half-finished sandwich on a desk. He runs down the hall and up the stairs towards his 

<p>father's room. He pauses, noticing there is no guard outside the Don's door. He walks around 

<p>the corner up to Room #2 and hesitates before he pushing the door open. His father is in the 

<p>bed, and Michael wonders if he's alive. He walks up to the Don. -night

<p>TOM (after they settle down)

<p>SONNY

<p>What about 'im?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>TOM

<p>Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey has agreed to be 

<p>the Turk's bodyguard. What you have to understand, Sonny, is that while Sollozzo is being 

<p>guarded like this, he is invulnerable. Now nobody has ever gunned down a New York police 

<p>captain -- never.  It would be disastrous. All the Five Families would come after you, Sonny. 

<p>The Corleone Family would be outcasts! Even the old man's political protection would run 

<p>for cover! So do me a favor -- take this into consideration.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SONNY

<p>MICHAEL (who's seated with his arms on the chair's arms)

<p>We can't wait. I don't care what Sollozzo says about a deal, he's gonna kill Pop, that's it. 

<p>That's the key for him. Gotta get Sollozzo.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CLEMENZA

<p>Mike is right...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SONNY

<p>Lemme ask you something, Professor, I mean -- what about McCluskey? Huh? What do we 

<p>do with this -- cop here?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL

<p>They wanna have a meeting with me, right? It will be me -- McCluskey -- and Sollozzo. 

<p>Let's set the meeting. Get our informers to find out where it's gonna be held. Now, we insist 

<p>it's a public place -- a bar, a restaurant -- some place where there's people so I feel safe. 

<p>They're gonna search me when I first meet them, right, so I can't have a weapon on me then. 

<p>But if Clemenza can figure a way -- to have a weapon planted there for me -- then I'll kill 

<p>'em both.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>[Clemenza, Tessio and Sonny laugh. Tom shrugs]

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SONNY

<p>Hey, whataya gonna do, nice college boy, eh? Didn't want to get mixed up in the Family 

<p>business, huh? Now you wanna gun down a police captain, why, because he slapped ya in 

<p>the face a little bit? Hah? What do you think this is the Army, where you shoot'em a mile 

<p>away? You've gotta get up close like this and bada-bing! you blow their brains all over your 

<p>nice Ivy League suit. Come're...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL (as Sonny kisses his head)

<p>Sonny...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SONNY

<p>You're taking this very personal. Tom, this is business and this man is taking it very very 

<p>personal.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL

<p>Where does it say that you can't kill a cop?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>HAGEN

<p>Come on, Mikey...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL

<p>Tom, wait a minute. I'm talking about a cop -- that's mixed up in drugs. I'm talking about ah 

<p>- ah - a dishonest cop -- a crooked cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was 

<p>coming to him. That's a terrific story. And we have newspaper people on the payroll, don't 

<p>we, Tom? 

<p>[Hagen nods in the affirmative]

<p>And they might like a story like that.

<p>They might, they just might...

<p>It's as cold as they come -- impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints, Mike. I put a 

<p>special tape on the trigger, and the butt. Here, try it...

<p>(then, after Michael tries it but doesn't shoot it)

<p>What's the matter, the trigger too tight?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL (after shooting the gun)

<p>Maron, my ears...

<p>CLEMENZA (laughs)

<p>Yeah, I left it noisy -- that way it scares any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders away.

<p>MICHAEL

<p>Sit down, finish my dinner...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CLEMENZA

<p>Come on, kid, don't fool around. Just let your hand drop to your side, and let the gun slip 

<p>out. Everybody'll still think you got it. They're gonna be staring at your face, Mike -- so walk 

<p>outta the place real fast -- but you don't run. Don't look nobody directly in the eye -- but you 

<p>don't look away, either. Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff of you, believe me, so don't worry 

<p>about nothin'. You know, you're going to turn out all right. You take a long vacation -- 

<p>nobody knows where -- and we're gonna catch the hell.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL

<p>How bad do you think it's gonna be?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CLEMENZA

<p>Pretty goddamn bad. Probably all the other Families will line up against us. That's alright -- 

<p>this thing's gotta happen every five years or so -- ten years -- helps to get rid of the bad 

<p>blood.  Been ten years since the last one. You know you got to stop them at the beginning, 

<p>like they should have stopped Hitler at Munich, They should never've let him get away with 

<p>that. They were just asking for big trouble. You know, Mike, we was all proud of you -- 

<p>being a hero and all. Your father, too.

<p>How much time do we have?

<p>CLEMENZA

<p>We could put a tail on them and see how it turns out...

<p>So why don't he just blast whoever's in the goddamn car?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>Well is it reliable?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SONNY

<p>That's my man in McCluskey's precinct. A police captain's gotta be on call twenty-four hours 

<p>a day. He signed out at that number between eight and ten. Anybody know this joint?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>TESSIO

<p>Yeah, sure, I do. It's perfect for us. A small family place, good food. Everyone minds his 

<p>business. It's perfect. Pete: they got an old-fashion'  toilet -- you know, the box, and - and - 

<p>and - ah the chain-thing. We might be able to tape the gun behind it.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CLEMENZA

<p>All right. Mike: you go to the restaurant, you eat, you talk for a while, you relax. You make 

<p>them relax. Then you get up and you go take a leak. No -- better still -- you ask for 

<p>permission to go. Then when you come back, you come out blastin', and don't take any 

<p>chances -- two shots in the head apiece.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SONNY

<p>Hey, listen, I want somebody good -- and I mean very good -- to plant that gun. I don't want 

<p>my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CLEMENZA

<p>The gun'll be there...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>Ah, I guess I'm gettin' too old for my job. Too grouchy -- can't stand the aggravation. You

<p>things, no disrespect intended, we wouldn't have this nonsense.  We will stop fighting until 

<p>your father is well and can resume bargaining.  No vengeance will be taken.  We will have

<p>DISSOLVE TO: Bank building boardroom in New York City. There are Dons and aides 

<p>seated and standing around a conference table. Barzini sits at the head of the table. -day

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE

<p>Don Barzini, I want to thank you for helping me organize this -- meeting here today. And 

<p>also the other heads of the Five Families -- New York and New Jersey. Carmine Corleone 

<p>from the Bronx -- and ah -- Brooklyn -- Philip Tattaglia.  An' from Staten Island, we have 

<p>with us Victor Strachi. And all the other associates that came as far as from California, and 

<p>Kansas City, and all the other territories of the country -- thank you.

<p>(then, sitting down)

<p>How did things ever get so far? I don't know. It was so -- unfortunate -- so unnecessary. 

<p>Tattaglia lost a son -- and I lost a son. We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees, then I'm willing 

<p>to -- let things go on the way they were before...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BARZINI

<p>We're all grateful to Don Corleone for calling this meeting. We all know him as a man of his 

<p>word -- a modest man -- he'll always listen to reason...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>TATTAGLIA

<p>Yes, Don Barzini -- he's too modest. He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket. He 

<p>refused to share them...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE

<p>When -- when did I ever refuse an accommodation? All of you know me here -- when did I 

<p>ever refuse? -- except one time. And why? Because -- I believe this drug business -- is gonna 

<p>destroy us in the years to come. I mean, it's not like gambling or liquor -- even women -- 

<p>which is something that most people want nowadays, and is ah forbidden to them by the 

<p><em>pezzonovante</em> of the Church. Even the police departments that've helped us in the past with 

<p>gambling and other things are gonna refuse to help us when in comes to narcotics. And I 

<p>believed that -- then -- and I believe that now.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BARZINI

<p>Times have changed. It's not like the Old Days -- when we can do anything we want. A 

<p>refusal is not the act of a friend. If Don Corleone had all the judges, and the politicians in 

<p>New York, then he must share them, or let us others use them. He must let us draw the water 

<p>from the well. Certainly he can -- present a bill for such services; after all -- we are not 

<p>Communists.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>ZALUCHI (after some laughter from the group, stands)

<p>I also don't believe in drugs. For years I paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind 

<p>of business. --

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>[Tattaglia whispers something to his aide]

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>ZALUCHI (continues)

<p>-- Somebody comes to them and says, "I have powders; if you put up three, four thousand 

<p>dollar investment -- we can make fifty thousand distributing." So they can't resist. I want to 

<p>control it as a business, to keep it respectable

<p>(then, as he slams his hand on the table)

<p>I don't want it near schools -- I don't want it sold to children! That's an <em>infamia</em>. In my city, 

<p>we would keep the traffic in the dark people -- the colored. They're animals anyway, so let 

<p>them lose their souls...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE

<p>I hoped that we would come here and reason together. And as a reasonable man I'm willing 

<p>to do whatever's necessary to -- find a peaceful solution to these problems...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BARZINI

<p>Then we are agreed. The traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled -- and Don 

<p>Corleone will give up protection in the East -- and there will be the peace.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>TATTAGLIA

<p>But I must have strict assurance from Corleone -- as time goes by and his position becomes 

<p>stronger, will he attempt any individual vendetta?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>BARZINI

<p>Look -- we are all reasonable men here; we don't have to give assurances as if we were 

<p>lawyers...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE (holding up his hand to interrupt Barzini)

<p>You talk about vengeance -- is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you? Or my boy to 

<p>me? I forgo the vengeance of my son -- But I have selfish reasons. My youngest son -- was 

<p>forced to leave this country, --

<p>(then, as he stands, with Tom's assistance)

<p>-- because of this Sollozzo business. All right -- and I have to make arrangements to bring 

<p>him back here safely -- cleared of all these false charges. But I'm a superstitious man -- and 

<p>if some unlucky accident should befall him -- if he should get shot in the head by a police 

<p>officer -- or if he -- should hang himself in his jail cell -- or if he's struck by a bolt of 

<p>lightning -- then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room. And that, I do not 

<p>forgive.

<p>(then)

<p>But -- that aside -- let me say that I swear -- on the souls of my grandchildren -- that I will 

<p>not be the one to break the peace that we have made here today...

<p>Yeah, I will take care...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>ANTHONY

<p>Give me orange...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>[The Don turns away and puts the piece of orange over his teeth. He turns toward 

<p>Anthony, grunting and holding his arms up like a monster. Anthony is startled, and starts to 

<p>cry. The Don rises, grabbing the boy]

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VITO CORLEONE (laughing)

<p>Oh no?

<p>(then, after picking up Anthony then setting him down again)

<p>That's a new trick -- 

<p>(then, pointing to the tomato garden)

<p>You run in there -- run in there...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>[Anthony runs through the tomato garden, laughing, with the spray can. He and the

<p>See -- where are you?

<p>(then)

<p>Get down!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>[The Don takes the orange peel out of his mouth, laughs, then coughs. He starts to 

<p>fall, grabs for a plant, then falls to the ground. Anthony is still laughing and running around]

<p>ANTHONY

<p>[Sounds like: I love you ... (more)]

<p>(then, as he runs up to the Don with the spray can)

<p>sitting in chairs in front of the Don's flower-covered casket. They watch as mourners place 

<p>single red roses on top. We see Johnny, Clemenza, and his wife toss roses. Barzini tosses a 

<p>rose, and glances at Michael and nods. We see Tessio walking from Barzini, towards 

<p>Michael. -day

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>TOM

<p>I always thought it would've been Clemenza, not Tessio...

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>MICHAEL

<p>It's a smart move -- Tessio was always smarter. But I'm gonna wait -- after the baptism. I've 

<p>decided to be Godfather to Connie's baby. And then I'll meet with Don Barzini -- and
